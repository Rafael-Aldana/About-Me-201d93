    Hi there, I'm Rafael Aldana in this website I'll be telling you a little bit about myself. I was born in the great state of Texas, traveled quite a bit as a child (not by choice). I spent the first few years of my life living in Guatemala. There I grew up in the country side working with cattle, chickens, crops, you name it my dad and I did just about everything. Then my family and I moved back to the states landing me in California. There I finished grade school later, moving to Washington state where I graduated high school. Growing up I always knew that I wanted to serve my people so, I knew I was either going to become a police officer or enlist in the military. Shortly after high school I mean shortly like a week after graduation I was on my way to basic training to start my journey in the military. After my basic schools I was stationed in Fort Drum New York. Fort Drum is the home of the light infantry so they deploy very often. I was deployed to the middle east, and soon after in a blink of an eye my active duty time was up. I ended up getting out of active duty and serving in the Washington State National Guard. I deployed to Poland for about a year and came back home once again in less than a blink of an eye my time was up with the National Guard. I got out the National Guard and continued my job as a contractor for the NAVY where I've working throughout my time after leaving active duty.I now reside in Washington state, where I enjoy a quit life with my girlfriend and our puppy. Now I am here attending code fellows seeking to learn to code and get the title of software developer. In hopes having a better life for me and my loved ones!
